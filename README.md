## Game Overview

Pharmacy technicians are healthcare workers who work under pharmacists to assist in dispensing prescription drugs to customers.  Primary duties of a technician include mixing, retrieving, pouring, counting, and labeling medication for customers.  Attention to detail is key in the pharmaceutical industry as careless errors can exacerbate a patientâ€™s condition or possibly be fatal.  It is also critical to accurately note and record customer information so as to avoid potential conflicts such as mixed up prescriptions or delivery delays.  With Pharmacy Simulator: Life in the Balance, we hope to educate players about proper pharmacy procedures to better prepare them for careers as pharmacy technicians and to potentially safeguard the lives of customers.
